# Gap Analysis & Implementation Plan: TeamPulse

You asked if the current files ([login.html](file:///C:/Users/krish/.gemini/antigravity/brain/8cadfbdb-2978-4663-9f6b-f2e1a30d3dab/TeamPulse/login.html), [employee_dashboard.html](file:///C:/Users/krish/.gemini/antigravity/brain/8cadfbdb-2978-4663-9f6b-f2e1a30d3dab/TeamPulse/employee_dashboard.html), [admin_dashboard.html](file:///C:/Users/krish/.gemini/antigravity/brain/8cadfbdb-2978-4663-9f6b-f2e1a30d3dab/TeamPulse/admin_dashboard.html)) are enough to meet your requirements.

**The short answer is: NO.**

Currently, we have only built the **"Skin"** (Frontend). We still need to build the **"Brain"** (PHP Logic) and the **"Memory"** (Database).

Here is the breakdown of what is missing and what we need to build to satisfy your requirements.

## 1. Database Layer (The Memory)
*Status: Not Started*
We need to create the database to store the data.
- [ ] **database_setup.sql**: The script to create the following tables:
  - `users`: For login and roles.
  - `projects`: To manage active projects.
  - `attendance`: To store login/logout times.
  - `breaks`: To track break intervals.
  - `work_logs`: For daily updates.

## 2. Backend Layer (The Brain)
*Status: Not Started*
We need PHP scripts to make the buttons work.

### Core System
- [ ] **db_connect.php**: Connects the website to the database.
- [ ] **auth_session.php**: Ensures only logged-in users access pages (Security Requirement).
- [ ] **logout.php**: Destroys the session securely.

### Functional Requirements Mapping

| Requirement | Current Status | Missing File / Action Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3.1 Authentication** | UI Ready | **login_action.php**: Check password & set session. |
| **3.2 Attendance** | UI Ready | **attendance_action.php**: Logic to insert "Login Time" & update "Logout Time". |
| **3.3 Break Mgmt** | UI Ready | **break_action.php**: Record start/end of breaks. |
| **3.4 Project Mgmt** | UI Ready | **manage_projects.php**: Admin screen to Add/Assign projects. |
| **3.5 Work Update** | UI Ready | **submit_log.php**: Save the daily work log to DB. |
| **3.7 Reporting** | UI Ready | **export_excel.php**: Generate .csv/.xlsx files from DB data. |

## 3. Frontend Integration
*Status: Pending*
We need to rename our [.html](file:///C:/Users/krish/.gemini/antigravity/brain/8cadfbdb-2978-4663-9f6b-f2e1a30d3dab/TeamPulse/login.html) files to `.php` and add the logic code inside them.

- [ ] [login.html](file:///C:/Users/krish/.gemini/antigravity/brain/8cadfbdb-2978-4663-9f6b-f2e1a30d3dab/TeamPulse/login.html) -> **login.php**: Add error messages (e.g., "Wrong password").
- [ ] [employee_dashboard.html](file:///C:/Users/krish/.gemini/antigravity/brain/8cadfbdb-2978-4663-9f6b-f2e1a30d3dab/TeamPulse/employee_dashboard.html) -> **dashboard_employee.php**:
    - Fetch real name from DB (`Welcome, <?php echo $name; ?>`).
    - Show real attendance status active/inactive.
    - Populate project dropdown from DB.
- [ ] [admin_dashboard.html](file:///C:/Users/krish/.gemini/antigravity/brain/8cadfbdb-2978-4663-9f6b-f2e1a30d3dab/TeamPulse/admin_dashboard.html) -> **dashboard_admin.php**:
    - Calculate real stats (Active, On Break).
    - Show live table data from DB.

## Summary of Next Steps
1.  **Create Database**: Run the SQL script. (Critical First Step)
2.  **Helpers**: Create `db_connect.php`.
3.  **Logic**: Implement `login_action.php` to allow you to actually log in.
4.  **Connect**: Convert HTML dashboards to PHP and link them to the database.
